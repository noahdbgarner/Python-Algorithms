# Python-Algorithms

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Description

This repository contains all of my favorite algorithms from leetcode, and most algorithms from my interviews. 
There is a google doc with notes linked to each of the algorithms.

### 1.2 Purpose

Employ a robust habit for studying and learning algorithms quickly. Note: All of these algorithms
are written on my whiteboard before being translated into runnable, testable code in the IDE. 
Google style docstrings.

## 2. Notes

Please see the [Python-Algorithms Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkKC-YeWV8bQ9gC1jIRmJYT-WzvI7zuRAWB4Fxb_JBA/edit#gid=0) to check my progress.
